# Krommatine Vault

Welcome to the Krommatine Vault. This is a collection of simple InDesign scripts from my workshop, built with both classic ExtendScript and modern UXP.

Their primary purpose is to demonstrate a core principle: a few lines of well written code can solve a frustrating workflow problem and save a significant amount of time.

Please think of these scripts as starting points, not as finished products. They are meant to show what's possible and to provide a useful foundation. They don't have user interfaces or the extensive error handling and edge case management that goes into my professional plugins.

## The Scripts

Here you will find a growing collection of scripts.

| Script | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **scale-paragraph-styles.idjs** | UXP Script | Proportionally scales the font size of each paragraph style, based on a user defined percentage. |
| **close-all-menu.idjs** | UXP Script | Adds a "Close All" menu to InDesign's File menu, allowing you to close all open documents at once, with or without saving changes. |
| *More to come...* | | |

## How to Use These Scripts

Installation for both modern UXP scripts (.idjs) and classic ExtendScript (.jsx) is the same straightforward process.

1.  Click the green "Code" button on this page and choose "Download ZIP".
2.  Unzip the downloaded file.
3.  Locate your InDesign Scripts Panel folder. The easiest way to find it is to open InDesign, show the Scripts panel (`Window > Utilities > Scripts`), right click on the "User" folder, and choose "Reveal in Finder" (macOS) or "Reveal in Explorer" (Windows).
4.  Copy the script file (`.idjs` or `.jsx`) into this "Scripts Panel" folder.
5.  The script will now appear in your InDesign Scripts panel, ready to run with a double click.

As a matter of good practice, you should always run scripts on a copy of your document first.

## Contributing

The craft improves through collaboration. If you see a way to refine a script, add a feature, or improve its error handling, your contributions are more than welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request.

## For Larger Challenges

When your problem requires more than a simple script, when you need a full user interface, robust error handling, and a dedicated partner to architect a complete workflow, my professional plugins and bespoke services are the next step.
